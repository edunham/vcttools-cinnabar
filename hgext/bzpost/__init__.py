"""Post changeset URLs to Bugzilla.

This extension will post the URLs of pushed changesets to Bugzilla
automatically.

To use, activate this extension by adding the following to your
hgrc:

    [extensions]
    bzpost = /path/to/version-control-tools/hgext/bzpost

You will also want to define your Bugzilla credentials in your hgrc to
avoid prompting:

    [bugzilla]
    username = foo@example.com
    password = password

After successfully pushing to a known Firefox repository, this extension
will add a comment to the first referenced bug in all pushed changesets
containing the URLs of the pushed changesets.

Limitations
===========

We currently only post comments to integration/non-release repositories.
This is because pushes to release repositories involve updating other
Bugzilla fields. This extension could support these someday - it just
doesn't yet.

User Repositories
=================

By default, we do not post pushes to user repositories. To enable posting
to user repositories, set the following in your hgrc:

    [bzpost]
    updateuserrepo = True

Excluding Trees from Automatic Updates
======================================

To prevent bzpost from automatically updating certain trees, set the
``bzpost.excludetrees`` config option to a list of tree names. e.g.

    [bzpost]
    excludetrees = try
