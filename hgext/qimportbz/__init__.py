"""qimportbz

Imports patches from bugzilla to your mercurial queue

Example:

  hg qimport bz://1234567

Configuration section is entirely optional but potentially useful::

  [qimportbz]
  bugzilla = server-address (defaults to BUGZILLA environment varable or bugzilla.mozilla.org)
  joinstr = string to join flags for commit messages (default is ' ')
  patch_format = Formatting string used to create patch names automatically. Set it to empty to use the initial filename.
  msg_format = Formatting string used to create commit messages automatically
  auto_choose_all = If multiple patches associated with a bug choose them all without prompting (default is False)

Formatting strings are the standard python format strings where a dictionary is used to supply the data.
For users of Mercurial 1.2: any % characters must be escaped since Python's configuration parser will try to interpret them.

There are 7 pieces of patch metadata available for use::

  "bugnum" : the bug number
  "id" : the patch id (internal bugzilla number)
  "title" : the bug title
  "desc" : the patch description
  "flags" : all the flags
  "filename" : the initial patch filename
  "bugdesc" : the bug description

The default values are::

  patch_format = %(filename)s
  msg_format = Bug %(bugnum)s - "%(title)s" [%(flags)s]
