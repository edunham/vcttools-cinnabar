  Commits to Mozilla projects are typically sent to MozReview. This is the
  preferred code review tool at Mozilla.
  
  Some still practice a legacy code review workflow that uploads patches
  to Bugzilla.
  
  1. MozReview only (preferred)
  2. Both MozReview and Bugzilla
  3. Bugzilla only
  
  Which code review tools will you be submitting code to?  1
  You do not have a Bugzilla API Key defined in your Mercurial config.
  
  In order to communicate with Bugzilla and services (like MozReview) that
  use Bugzilla for authentication, you'll need to supply an API Key.
  
  The Bugzilla API Key is optional. However, if you don't supply one,
  certain features may not work and/or you'll be prompted for one.
  
  You should only need to configure a Bugzilla API Key once.
  What is your Bugzilla email address? (optional) 
  Configure the "review" path so you can `hg push review` commits to Mozilla for review (Yn)?  y
  Your config file needs updating.

  Your existing Mercurial config uses a legacy method for defining Bugzilla
  credentials. Bugzilla API Keys are the most secure and preferred method
  for defining Bugzilla credentials. Bugzilla API Keys are also required
  if you have enabled 2 Factor Authentication in Bugzilla.
  
  For security reasons, the legacy credentials are being removed from the
  config.
