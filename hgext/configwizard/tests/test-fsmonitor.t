  The fsmonitor extension integrates the watchman filesystem watching tool
  with Mercurial. Commands like `hg status`, `hg diff`, and `hg commit`
  (which need to examine filesystem state) can query watchman to obtain
  this state, allowing these commands to complete much quicker.
  
  When installed, the fsmonitor extension will automatically launch a
  background watchman daemon for accessed Mercurial repositories. It
  should "just work."
