Too old version will fail outright

  $ rm fakeversion.pyc
  $ cat >> fakeversion.py << EOF
  > util.version = lambda: '3.4.2'
  > EOF

  $ hg $FAKEVERSION --config configwizard.steps=hgversion configwizard
  Your version of Mercurial (3.4) is too old to run `hg configwizard`.
  
  Mozilla's Mercurial support policy is to support at most the past
  1 year of Mercurial releases (or 4 major Mercurial releases).
  
  Please upgrade to Mercurial 3.5 or newer and try again.
  
  See https://mozilla-version-control-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hgmozilla/installing.html
  for Mozilla-tailored instructions for install Mercurial.
  abort: upgrade Mercurial then run again
