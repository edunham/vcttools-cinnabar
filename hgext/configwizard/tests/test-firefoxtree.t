  The firefoxtree extension makes interacting with the multiple Firefox
  repositories easier:
  
  * Aliases for common trees are pre-defined. e.g. `hg pull central`
  * Pulling from known Firefox trees will create "remote refs" appearing as
    tags. e.g. pulling from fx-team will produce a "fx-team" tag.
  * The `hg fxheads` command will list the heads of all pulled Firefox repos
    for easy reference.
  * `hg push` will limit itself to pushing a single head when pushing to
    Firefox repos.
  * A pre-push hook will prevent you from pushing multiple heads to known
    Firefox repos. This acts quicker than a server-side hook.
  
  The firefoxtree extension is *strongly* recommended if you:
  
  a) aggregate multiple Firefox repositories into a single local repo
  b) perform head/bookmark-based development (as opposed to mq)
  
  (Relevant config option: extensions.firefoxtree)
  
  Would you like to activate firefoxtree (Yn)?  n
