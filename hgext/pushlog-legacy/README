pushlog-feed.py:

This extension works in conjunction with the hg_record_changeset_info hook,
to provide a feed of the repository push log. The push log records when
pushes were made to a repository, what the head revision was at the time, and
who performed the push.

To install these extensions for use in apache, place the following .hgrc
file in the apache home directory (/var/www/.hgrc on FC8):

[extensions]
pushlog-feed = /path/to/pushlog-feed.py

This extension also relies on the gitweb_mozilla templates:
http://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/hg_templates/

Clone the hg_templates repository somewhere and add the following lines to the .hgrc:
[web]
templates=/Users/luser/build/hg_templates
style=gitweb_mozilla
