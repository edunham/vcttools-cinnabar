hgwebjson.py:

This is a mercurial extension. It exists to allow hgweb to produce JSON
output describing revisions. Advanced clients can be built on this output,
see the www/ directory for an example.

pushlog-feed.py:

This extension works in conjunction with the hg_record_changeset_info hook,
to provide a feed of the repository push log. The push log records when
pushes were made to a repository, what the head revision was at the time, and
who performed the push.

To install these extensions for use in apache, place the following .hgrc
file in the apache home directory (/var/www/.hgrc on FC8):

[extensions]
hgwebjson = /path/to/hgwebjson.py
pushlog-feed = /path/to/pushlog-feed.py
