Configuring Your Machine to Use MozReview
=========================================

Obtaining Accounts, Credentials, and Privileges
===============================================

Pushing to MozReview to **initiate** code review requires the following:

* An active ``bugzilla.mozilla.org`` (BMO) account
* A BMO API Key
* (optional) A Mozilla LDAP account with Mercurial access and a
  registered SSH key

A BMO account can be created at https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/createaccount.cgi.

Once you have an account, visit
https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey to generate a new
API Key. The API Key can have any description you want. We recommend
something like ``mercurial``. The API Key won't be used until later, so
you don't have to generate it right away.

Instructions for obtaining a Mozilla LDAP account with Mercurial access
are documented at
`Becoming A Mozilla Contributor <https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/commit/>`_.

LDAP/SSH Versus HTTP
====================

Reviews are initiated with MozReview by pushing to a Mercurial *review*
repository using ``hg push``. Pushing via both SSH and HTTP are supported.

Pushing via HTTP is the easiest to configure **and is recommended for
new contributors**. All you need to push via HTTP is an active Bugzilla
account and Bugzilla API Key.

Pushing via SSH requires a Mozilla LDAP account configured with
Mercurial access and with a registered SSH key. This involves a little
more time and work to obtain. **This is recommended for Mozilla staff and
beyond-casual contributors.**

.. important::

   Pushing via SSH grants additional privileges in the MozReview web
   interface, such as the ability to trigger *Try* jobs and interact
   with the *Autoland* code landing service. If you push things via HTTP
   and have never pushed via SSH before, you will need someone else to
   trigger *Try* jobs for you.

Updating SSH Config
-------------------

If you are using SSH to push to MozReview, you will want to configure your
SSH username for ``reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org``. See :ref:`auth_ssh` for
instructions on updating your SSH client configuration..

.. tip::

   If you have already configured ``hg.mozilla.org`` in your SSH config,
   just copy the settings to ``reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org``.

As of January 2016, the SSH fingerprints for the RSA keys are:

* ``SHA256:O6C9zLi4leD/mb4lPNmR50R1ampZgeEi7StDEbZDmyA``
* ``MD5:a6:13:ae:35:2c:20:2b:8d:f4:8d:8e:d7:a8:55:67:97``

Simple Client Configuration
===========================

If you already have a Firefox repository like
`mozilla-central <https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central>`_ cloned, you
can run ``mach mercurial-setup`` from it and a guided wizard will walk
you through configuring Mercurial for optimal use at Mozilla.
Configuring Mercurial for MozReview is part of this wizard.

.. important::

   The wizard currently does not configure the ``autoreview``
   repository. See :ref:`mozreview_install_autoreview` for how to do
   this manually.

If you don't have a Firefox repository, have no fear: just follow the
instructions below.

Installing the Mercurial Extension
==================================

Interacting with MozReview from Mercurial **requires** a Mercurial
extension to be installed and configured.

To install that extension, clone the
`version-control-tools <https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools>`_
repository and activate the ``hgext/reviewboard/client.py`` extension in
your ``hgrc``. For example::

  $ hg clone https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools ~/version-control-tools
  $ cat >> ~/.hgrc << EOF
  [extensions]
  reviewboard = ~/version-control-tools/hgext/reviewboard/client.py
  EOF

.. note::

   You likely already have an ``[extensions]`` section in your Mercurial
   configuration. Run ``hg config --edit --global`` (or ``hg config -e
   -g`` for short) to open your global configuration in an editor and
   add the aforementioned extension under the ``[extensions]`` section.

Configuring the Mercurial Extension
===================================

The Mercurial extension requires additional Mercurial configuration file
options before it can be used.

Bugzilla Credentials
--------------------

You will need to define your BMO credentials in your Mercurial
configuration in order to authenticate with MozReview. These are placed
under the ``[bugzilla]`` section in your configuration file. Again,
``hg config -e -g`` to open an editor and place something like the
following in your config file::

  [bugzilla]
  ; Your Bugzilla username. This is an email address.
  username = me@example.com
  ; A Bugzilla API key
  apikey = ojQBGzhDmFYRFSX4xWNCSyOEsJKqisU0l0EJqXh6

.. note::

   You can generate or obtain an already-generated API Key from
   https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/userprefs.cgi?tab=apikey.

.. important::

   Logging into MozReview will create a Bugzilla API Key named
   ``mozreview``. This API Key has limited permissions and isn't
   suitable for general use. It is recommended to create an API
   Key named ``mercurial`` or ``hg`` and define that in your Mercurial
   config.

IRC Nickname
------------

MozReview currently uses your IRC nickname as an identifier when
creating reviews. You will need to define it in your Mercurial
configuration file under the ``[mozilla]`` section.

Use the following as a template::

  [mozilla]
  ircnick = mynick

Configuring Review Repositories/Paths
=====================================

You almost certainly want to define the URL you will be pushing to in
your Mercurial configuration so you can type a short name (e.g.
``review``) rather than a full URL (which is longer and harder to
remember).

The sections below describe how to do this.

.. _mozreview_install_autoreview:

Configuring the Auto Review Repository
--------------------------------------

There is a special repository called the ``autoreview`` repository that
will automatically see what you are pushing and *redirect* your push to
the appropriate code review repository. In other words, you don't need
to configure a review path/remote for each clone: you simply define an
alias to the ``autoreview`` repository in your global Mercurial
configuration file and it should *just work*.

Using ``hg config -e -g`` to edit your global Mercurial configuration
file, add an entry under the ``[paths]`` section like so (be sure to use
the appropriate HTTP or SSH URL depending on what you have configured)::

   [paths]
   # For HTTP pushing
   review = https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/autoreview

   # For SSH pushing
   review = ssh://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/autoreview

Now, you can ``hg push review`` from any Mercurial repository and it
will go to the ``autoreview`` repository and redirect to the appropriate
review repository automatically!

Advanced Paths Configuration
----------------------------

If the *auto review* repository is too much magic for you, you can
define the review URL for each repository you wish to review from.

.. important::

   We highly recommend the ``autoreview`` repository because it is much
   simpler to manage.

You will want to define a named path in your per-repository hgrc file.
We recommend the name ``review``. The URL for the repository is
``https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/<repo>`` or
``ssh://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/<repo>`` (depending on whether you
are pushing over HTTP or SSH, respectively) where ``<repo>`` is
the name of a repository.

You can find the list of available repositories at
https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/. For SSH URls, Just replace ``https://``
with ``ssh://``.

Edit your repository-local config via ``hg config -e`` and adjust your
``[paths]`` section to resemble something like::

  [paths]
  default = https://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools
  default-push = ssh://hg.mozilla.org/hgcustom/version-control-tools

  # For HTTP pushing
  review = https://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/version-control-tools

  # For SSH pushing
  review = ssh://reviewboard-hg.mozilla.org/version-control-tools
