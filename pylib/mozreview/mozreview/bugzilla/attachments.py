    # may get out of sync with the reality from Bugzilla. Fortunately,
    # Review Board is smarter than that. Internally, the target_people list

    # table. If the RB username changes, this won't impact target_people
    # nor the stored mapping to the numeric Bugzilla ID, which is
    # immutable.
    #

    # address. Review Board's stored email address could be stale. So
    # instead of using it directly, we query Bugzilla and map the stored,
    # immutable numeric Bugzilla userid into an email address. This lookup
    # could be avoided if Bugzilla accepted a numeric userid in the
    # requestee parameter when modifying an attachment.
