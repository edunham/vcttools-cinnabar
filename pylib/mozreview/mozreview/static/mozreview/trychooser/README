This is a clone of https://hg.mozilla.org/build/tools/file/tip/trychooser

It's required because http://trychooser.pub.build.mozilla.org/ doesn't yet have
https support, which is required for embedding within MozReview.

trychooser is slightly modified to remove jquery-ui.css and the reference to it
in index.html.  None of the styles it provides are actually used, and it was
preventing the mozreview egg from being built due to non-existent images that
are referenced.

Once https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1302631 has been fixed, this
can be removed.
