Because Review Board's support for Django Evolutions in extensions is shaky,
we unfortunately need to execute SQL schema changes directly on the database
when models change.  This directory contains such migration scripts.

Furthermore, because Django Evolution will complain if the schema is
changed manually, we have to reset the Evolution-related tables.  This needs
to be done each time migrations are performed, by executing the SQL
commands in clear-evolution-sigs.sql.

You must do a database backup before applying any migrations.
