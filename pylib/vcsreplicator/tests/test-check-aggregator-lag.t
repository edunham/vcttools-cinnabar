Stop the aggregator so there is message lag

  $ hgmo exec hgssh /usr/bin/supervisorctl stop pushdataaggregator
  pushdataaggregator: stopped

No issues reported when thresholds aren't met

  $ hgmo create-repo repo0 1
  (recorded repository creation in replication log)

  $ hgmo exec hgweb1 /var/hg/venv_replication/bin/vcsreplicator-consumer --wait-for-no-lag /etc/mercurial/vcsreplicator.ini
