Creating a repo outside of the managed path should raise an error

  abort: repository path not configured for replication
  (add entry to [replicationpathrewrites])

Trying to replicate a repo outside of a managed path should raise an error
(this assumes `hg init` doesn't delete the repo when replication fails, which is
a poor assertion)

  $ hgmo exec hgssh /var/hg/venv_pash/bin/hg -R /tmp/repo0 replicatesync
  abort: repository path not configured for replication
  (add entry to [replicationpathrewrites])
  [255]

Cleanup

  $ hgmo clean
