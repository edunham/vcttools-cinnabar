  **************************** WARNING ****************************
  Your push does not contain any try syntax, so no jobs will be
  scheduled automatically. If this was intentional, you can still
  schedule jobs by selecting the drop down at the top right of your
  push in treeherder and choosing 'Add new Jobs'.
  
  If you meant to schedule jobs, remember the try syntax must
  appear in the *last* commit of your push. For assistance with try
  server, see https://wiki.mozilla.org/Try.
  *****************************************************************
  
Pushing a changeset with '-p none' should error out

  $ echo 'working' > foo
  $ hg commit -m 'try: -b do -p none'

  ***************************** ERROR ******************************
  Your try syntax would not trigger any jobs. Either specify a build
  with '-p' or an arbitrary job with '-j'. If you intended to push
  without triggering any jobs, omit the try syntax completely. For
  assistance with try server, see https://wiki.mozilla.org/Try.
