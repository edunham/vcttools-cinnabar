# We have an additional virtualenv in Docker to run moz.build info
# directly from hgweb without the secure execution environment we
# run in production. We do this because we can't execute the secure
# wrapper inside Docker because of limited privileges of Docker
# containers. This is unfortunate. But it's what we have to do for
# now.
