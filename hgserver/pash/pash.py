A SSH connection has been established, your account (%s)

However, Mercurial access is currently disabled on your account.
This commonly occurs due to account inactivity (you need to SSH
into hg.mozilla.org every few months to keep your account active).

To restore Mercurial access, please file a MOC Service Request
bug (http://tinyurl.com/njcfhma) and request hg access be restored
for %s.
